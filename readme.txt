This program creates passwords using a pattern generator.

Some regex-like syntax is used to allow for backtracking and other slightly
advanced features.

Usage notes:
- supports lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and some special characters
- separates vowels and consonants, for easier memorization of passwords
- allows length selection between 6 and 36 characters
- character literals are available, as well as randomized character classes
- can "store" characters to be re-used later
